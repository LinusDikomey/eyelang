# eyelang
A basic programming language. The compiler is written in rust using LLVM as its backend.
Also contains an interpreter that is being used for running programs right now until the LLVM backend is ready.

## TO DO (for first real program to run):
- [x] Basic features:
    - [x] Expressions/Statements/Blocks
    - [x] Functions
    - [x] if/else
    - [x] struct definitions
    - [x] Binary operations (+, -, *, /)
    - [x] Function calls/arguments
- [x] Lexer
- [x] Parser
- [x] Typechecker (basic variant)
- [x] Interpreter

# Next steps
- [x] Binary operations
- [x] function calls
- [ ] struct instantiation
- [ ] dot field access

# Compilation
- [ ] Finish typechecker
- [ ] LLVM backend
